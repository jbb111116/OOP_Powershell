# OOP_Powershell
Repo to begin testing OOP principles for App Support applications

What I need currently:
Need DTO layer, where it transfers the information internally
Need Service layer, where it applies the logic to different objects
Need Model layer, to have models that we can use for uniformity within all layers
Need Repo/DAO layer, to retrieve information from external sources
Need controller layer, delegates the request/command from the UI/terminal layer, could be renamed to module layer
